I've been seeing a lot of posts that could be found from a simple Google search, so I'll be consolidating and answering many of those questions here.

## FAQs

1. Is it safe to mod your console?

For the most part, it is safe to mod your console if you're following the proper practices. You will want to use emummc/emunand whenever possible. You also should only install application from developers and sources you trust. Brickware is more common then you would think. Piracy is also a great way to get your console damaged.

2. Will I get banned if I mod my console?

Likely not, once again, if you follow all of the correct practices, you will be safe (emummc, blocking nintendo servers with DNS, etc.) If you play online within a modded emummc, you will not be safe. If you pirate, you would also not be safe. I have not heard of a single person who wasn't cheating or pirating who was banned.

3. Is homebrew illegal?

This is a complicated question, homebrew is in a gray area legally. Nobody had been arrested directly because of homebrew who weren't involved with something like piracy. No company would go after individuals for this. Piracy, no matter what, isn't legal. Just as running into a mall and stealing a game physically isn't legal. As such, we will be unable to help with piracy of games here.

4. How would I install homebrew on my console?

These are the guides recommended by the community. Following a video guide will likely resolve in something being messed up as many of the creators aren't reputable and are likely out of date.

5. What size SD card do I need?

*Always stick to reputable brands such as Samsung, SanDisk, PNY, Lexar, or SiliconPower*

For the Wii, get a 32 gb card. The Wii doesn't really support anything higher. If you're backing up games, use an external drive as the SD card slot on the Wii is slow.

For the Switch, it really just depends on what you're doing. If you'll be backing up cartridges, get a large card. Switch cartridges can be up to 32 gb each, so plan accordingly. 256gb micro SD cards are pretty cheap and are large enough to store multiple games. Do not get a card smaller than 64gb, as the emummc partition will take at least 32gb. You also should factor in if you will make Android/Linux partitions as those will take away additional space.

Switchroot android and Linux should be used on a application class 2 card (or equivalent/better) This is shown on cards with a *A2* marking on the front.

Most other consoles have pretty small games, so if you're backing up, you can get away with smaller cards.

This card should be fine for most purposes, but you should shop around a bit more since prices across retailers will fluctuate.

     - Formats SD cards correctly, using the built-in windows format tool may cause issues, especially on larger cards.

That's all for now, I'll update this later as needed.
